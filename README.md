## üìñ Overview

The goal is to build a binary classification model to predict if a person's income is **<=50K** or **>50K** using attributes like age, occupation, education level, and hours worked per week.

This project helps in:
- HR analytics
- Job profiling
- Resource allocation

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. Upload the CSV file (e.g., `adult.csv`)
2. Data is cleaned:
   - Replace '?' values
   - Drop irrelevant or inconsistent rows
   - Label encode categorical features
3. User selects a model
4. Model is trained and tested
5. Accuracy is displayed
6. User inputs custom data to make predictions
7. App returns predicted salary class
